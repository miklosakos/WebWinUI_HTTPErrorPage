# WebWinUI HTTP error page
Just a basic http error page for WebWinUI, BSOD styled

It need PHP to work since that's how I made it to be "responsive".

Install instructions:

Open your .htaccess file and modify /path/to/errors to the location where you put the HTTP error page files.

.htaccess file goes to your domain's / webserver's root directory (i.e. /public_html) directly.
